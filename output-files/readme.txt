This directory contains the output files of modelv[1-6], as well as some files outputted from various debugging attempts. 
In this directory are subdirectories:
    - debugging: the results of debugging. These should have a description of what was going on as the first line but often don't. Not in use. 
    - modelv4_format: output files from modelv4. Contains its own readme. 
    - modelv5_format: contains calcFR (output from calculateFiringRates), L4_only (firing rates of L4 neurons in response to stimuli with no other layers attached), and L23_recurrent (firing rates of L23 after recurrence). Also files generated by testing STDP. Name patterns not standardized.
