Including:
    	- modelv1.py: input vector to get output of what spiked with L4 only
    	- modelv2.py:  L4 and L23 without recurrence, but L23 acts as if all L4 neurons spiked
    	- modelv3.py: L4 and L23 without recurrence; L23 uses L4 spiking as input
        - modelv4.py: L4 and L23 with recurrence, but only one timebin
        - modelv5.py: able to do as many timebins as there are stimuli inputs.
